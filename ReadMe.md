#### Fraud Detection Challenge

The goal of this challange is to create a machine learning model to detect fradulent transactions to help Xente provide improved and safer services to its customers. 

`Approach`

- Understand how financial transactions works
- Explore how fraud occurs in this space
- Get past data showing transactions and whether or not it was fraudulent or not
- Apply several classification algorithms to build out a ML model that can accurately predict a fradualent transaction
- Select a model whose F1 evaluation score is the highest.
